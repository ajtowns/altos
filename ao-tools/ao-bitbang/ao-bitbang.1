.TH AO-BITBANG 1 "ao-bitbang" ""
.SH NAME
ao-bitbang \- Low-level cc1111 interface diagnostic tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ao-bitbang"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ao-bitbang
connects through a CP2103 usb-to-serial converter and uses the GPIO
pins to communicate with the debug port on a cc1111 device. It
provides raw access to the debug pins to help debug the lowest level
communication path.
.SH USAGE
.I ao-bitbang
reads a sequence of bit manipulations from stdin, sends them to the
device and reports status on stdout.
.P
Each line on stdin should contain a single letter command for each of
the three debug lines on the cc1111 -- clock, data and reset. Each bit
can be in one of three states -- on (C, D or R), off (.) or tri-state
(-) for input. Empty lines, or lines starting with '#' are
ignored. Anything beyond the last bit in a line is also ignored. The
bits must be listed in the correct order, and the 'on' values must
match the desired bit.
