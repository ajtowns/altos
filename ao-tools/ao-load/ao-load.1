.SH NAME
ao-load \- flash a program to a AltOS device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ao-load"
[\-T \fItty-device\fP]
[\--tty \fItty-device\fP]
[\-D \fIaltos-device\fP]
[\--device \fIaltos-device\fP]
[\--cal \fIradio-calibration\fP]
\fIfile.ihx\fP
\fIdevice serial number\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ao-load
loads the specified .ihx file into the target device flash memory,
customizing the AltOS image with the specified serial number.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-T tty-device | --tty tty-device
This selects which tty device the debugger uses to communicate with
the target device. The special name 'BITBANG' directs ao-dbg to use
the cp2103 connection, otherwise this should be a usb serial port
connected to a suitable cc1111 debug node.
.TP
\-D AltOS-device | --device AltOS-device
Search for a connected device. This requires an argument of one of the
following forms:
.IP
TeleMetrum:2
.br
TeleMetrum
.br
2
.IP
Leaving out the product name will cause the tool to select a suitable
product, leaving out the serial number will cause the tool to match
one of the available devices.
.TP
\-c radio-calibration | --cal radio-calibration
This programs the radio calibration value into the image for hardware
which doesn't have any eeprom storage for this value. The value here
can be computed given the current radio calibration value, the
measured frequency and the desired frequency:
.IP
	cal' = cal * (desired/measured)
.IP
The default calibration value is 1186611.
.SH USAGE
.I ao-load
reads the specified .ihx file into memory, locates the matching .map
file and edits the image to customize it using the specified serial
number. It then connects to the specified target device and writes the
program to the target device flash memory.
