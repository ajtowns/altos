    doc: Add remaining configurable parameters to the System Operation chapter
    
    Yes, this duplicates the section in the AltosUI chapter, but I'm not
    sure how to describe the device without talking about it in two
    places, so we might as well make both of them complete.

    altos: Put locked/unlocked GPS status in APRS comments
    
    Replace the 'S' (which marks the field showing sats in view) with
    either 'L' or 'U' to tell the user whether the GPS receiver is locked
    or unlocked.
    
    This also removes the colons in the comment field to shorten it. This
    makes it fit on one line of my FT1D display.

commit 5001a0f882af53dde33fc531215944c9d727baf4

    altos: Re-send previous GPS position in APRS if lock is lost
    
    APRS radios often show only the last received APRS packet, which means
    that erasing the last known GPS position when we lose lock by sending
    0/0/0 is unhelpful. Instead, just send the last known position, and
    make sure that we send 0/0/0 before we're locked the first time.

    altos: Use factory calibration for all acceleration computations
    
    The ground acceleration value will vary depending on the tilt angle of
    the airframe, which will result in incorrect acceleration computations
    during flight. This also avoids accidental boost detect when moving
    the airframe around in pad mode.

    altos: Flip acceleration data consistently for orientation changes
    
    Must flip the acceleration calibration data using the same function as
    flipping the actual acceleration data or the calibration will no
    longer be valid after changing orientation. For the MMA655x, this
    means using 4095 in both places, rather than using 0x7fff for the
    calibration data changes and 4095 for the data value changes. For the
    MPU6000, this means using 0 in both places.

    This doesn't check for fine calibration, just makes sure the part is

    bitpattern definition which caused the reset to fail, making it hard
    to self-test the part, as self-test is only valid before the part is running.

    important not to have that thread discard the InterruptedException so

    see them so that they can exit cleanly.

    altos: Oops. Was only filling out part of the TeleMetrum ADC record
    
    Because it's missing a return, we'd end up filling out one element of
    the ADC record per interrupt, and rotating through which one was set,
    hitting all of the even offsets within the struct. Yikes!

    The new Hexfile symbol code automatically adds the needed romconfig

    altosuilib: Don't match product_altusmetrum for product_basestation or product_altimeter
    
    It's been years since we've shipped boards configured with
    product_altusmetrum, but now we've repurposed that code for the flash
    loader. When matching an explicit product, go ahead and also match
    altusmetrum so that the flash loader will fit, but when matching
    basestation or altimeter, don't as that will avoid popping up the
    flight monitor UI at startup when a board is running the boot loader.

    Instead, use a correct-but-expensive function with a pile of

    buffer location to find the last ground location rather than working
    forwards from the first buffered location. This ensures that we don't
    capture noise before boost and instead capture a nice flight curve instead.

    In derivative code, use a shorter filter during ascent as the baro

    the very first few baro samples can be noisy, which generates a bad

    altos/cc1111: Hack on USB driver to make Windows happy
    
    The Windows modem driver is quite chatty at startup time, getting and
    setting the comm parameters each time the device is opened. Sometimes,
    when setting the parameters, the cc1111 would STALL EP0.
    
    Most of the time, Windows would happily pass this as an error back to
    AltosUI which would then re-try the open (and succeed, most of the
    time).
    
    Sometimes, Windows would stall for 30 seconds before passing the error
    back. This made the whole UI freeze, and I suspect most people assumed
    our app had died.
    
    A bit of analysis with the beagle USB sniffer and I discovered the
    STALL settings, but there wasn't any correlation between the data on
    the wire and when the STALL would be generated.
    
    So, I found a couple of other cc1111 USB stacks on the net and just
    looked to see how our driver differed. There wasn't anything clearly
    related, but there were a list of small differences:
    
     1) Other drivers didn't bother waiting for the hardware to
        ack the USBADDR setting; doing it this way means we can set
        the address *before* acking the setup packet. It'll get
        set eventually, at which point the device will start responding to
        packets again.
    
        Easy to fix, and saves a bit of code space too.
    
     2) The other drivers set the STALL bit for setup packets which aren't
        understood. This shouldn't have any effect on 'good' systems as
        those shouldn't ever be generating bogus setup packets anyways.
    
        The driver already handled the STALL state in the interrupt
        handler, the only requirement was to figure out when to explicitly
        set the STALL bit.
    
        That required moving the state updating code from the start of the
        ep0 setup handling to the end, after the setup packet had been
        examined and data queued in or out as appropriate.
    
     3) Our driver explicitly queued an IN packet for any setup request
        that wasn't waiting for an OUT pack. This appears to tie in with
        the USBADDR change above as before I made that change, this change
        caused the driver to fail to respond to most setup packets.
    
        This was simple once the above change was made, just move the
        generation of the IN packet inside the code that switched to the
        IN state.

    altos: Set APRS deviation to 3kHz
    
    I finally found a bunch of references to APRS on the net and they all
    appear to assume a 3kHz deviation. Let's see if this works better with
    Yaesu radios.

    ao-tools/ao-stmload: Be smarter about ELF parsing. Retry open on failure.
    
    Figuring out what goes where is tricky; turns out we want to pull all
    of the sections that map inside any program area that is supposed to
    be loaded from the file.
    
    So, we walk the program headers, then walk all of the section headers
    looking for those that suck data from the same portion of the
    file. Compute where in ROM each relevant section goes and build a full
    ROM image in memory using that.
    
    This patch also adds code to close and re-open the device if the first
    open failed to do what we want. Much nicer to have the computer figure
    out when the open succeeded rather than having people re-run the app.

    altos/stm: Always check for idle IN buffer before sending
    
    Unlike the AVR and CC1111 USB drivers, the STM usb driver queues IN
    bytes in a local buffer instead of in the driver; this means that the
    driver is queuing bytes while the previous IN packet is queued for the
    host, which allows for overlapping execution.
    
    It also means that when the local buffer is full, we must check to see
    if the host has picked up the previous IN packet before trying to
    queue another IN packet for transmission. This is done by always
    waiting for the IN buffer to be ready before sending data.

    altos: Get CC115L radio working.
    
    This involved figuring out which GPIO signal would reliably indicate
    that the transmitter was finished; I ended up using the PA_PD bit for

    This also converts all of the radio users to the long packet support
    as the CC115L has only a 64-byte fifo, not large enough to hold either
    an RDF tone or a regular AltOS telemetry packet.
    
    This also renames the public API for sending APRS packets from
    ao_radio_send_lots to ao_radio_send_aprs, which is at least more
    accurate. The workings of that API haven't changed, just the name.

    altos: Correct model error covariance matrix
    
    Finally found a couple of decent references on how to set the model
    (process) error covariance matrix. The current process matrix turns
    out to be correct for a continuous kalman filter (which isn't
    realizable, of course). For a discrete filter, the error in modeled
    acceleration (we model it as a constant) needs to be propogated to the
    speed and position portions of the matrix.
    
    The correct matrix is seen in this paper:
    
    On Reduced-Order Kalman Filters For GPS Position Filtering
    	J. Shima
    	6/2/2001
    
    This references an older paper which is supposed to describe the
    derivation of the matrix:
    
    Singer, R.A., “Estimating Optimal Tracking Filter Performance for Manned Maneuvering Targets,”
    IEEE Transactions of Aerospace and Electronic Systems, AES-5, July 1970, pp. 473-483.
    
    This change has a minor effect on the computed correction
    coefficients; it should respond more reasonably to acceleration
    changes now.

    altos: Change CC1120 SPI speed to 4MHz.
    
    Most of the chip can run at 8MHz, but extended register access is
    limited to 6.1MHz. Instead of pushing things, just run the SPI bus at
    4MHz.

    altos: Set STM GPIO output speed for SPI pins correctly
    
    The GPIO pin settings affect the output impedence, and hence the
    maximum speed for SPI. Cranking these to suitable values allows SPI to
    run at full speed.

    altos: Time out reading packet data from cc1120 after 100ms
    
    Sometimes the radio will give a spurious wakeup indicating that a
    preamble seems to have arrived, but no packet data will appear. In
    this case, abandon the packet reception and go back to waiting for a
    preamble again. This releases the SPI bus for other users and also
    avoids missing packets.

    altos: Wire up another CC1120 GPIO to get MARC status changes
    
    When the radio drops out of RX or TX mode due to an error, it changes
    the MARC status, and sends pulse down a configured GPIO. Use this to
    tell when something 'bad' happened during TX or RX so that we can
    recover from losing the SPI bus in the middle of transmission or
    reception.
    
    Without this, the radio would change state and we'd never know,
    leaving the radio code waiting for an interrupt that would never arrive.

    altos: Add ao_task_minimize_latency to reduce IRQ delays
    
    When set, this causes the task switching code to avoid blocking IRQs
    while looking for an idle task as that can increase IRQ latencies
    enough to drop characters at 115200 baud on the cc1111. Note that this
    *also* eliminates the ability to use low power modes as we cannot know
    at any point whether some interrupt has come along and woken a task.
    
    Has no effect when using task queues as those require IRQs to be
    blocked while looking at the queue. Shouldn't be a problem there
    though as the check for no running tasks is very cheap.

    altos: Replace __critical usage with ao_arch_critical as needed
    
    sdcc offers __critical as a machine-independent way to block

    port, but some old __critical usages remained.
    
    This fixes a bunch of random hangs when communicating with MM over USB
    or the radio as the various stdio loops were running without
    interrupts blocked between the test and the sleep.

    altosdroid: match only the current version tag
    
    Don't match non version tags - and always return the long format of
    git describe, rather than just the tag (when the tag is on the current
    commit).
    
    Split the commit number/hash more reliably by removing the version tag
    from the result first.

    And clean up the whole flight value reporting code base. It would be

    in each tab.

    altos: spiradio debug serial is port 1, not port 0
    
    The SPI link uses port 0; it seems like the having the two try to
    share the same wires is a bad plan.

Author: Keith Packard <keithp@keithp.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 29 11:23:13 2012 -0700

    altos: SPI radio - use 1->0 for 'done' and 0->1 for 'ready'
    
    This changes how the SPI radio protocol uses the interrupt
    line. Instead of a pulse indicating operation done, this now uses a 0
    value for done and a 1 value for ready. The key distinction is that
    the master can tell when the slave is waiting for the next command
    instead of hoping that it got done 'soon enough'.

    We look at the out_done value, but not the in_done value; if we use

    for completion. This way, we can ignore that value and use the
    existing ao_aes_dma_out_done value.

    altos: Add support for multiple SPI busses and sharing device drivers
    
    The STM32L151 has several SPI busses, and we want to use more than
    one, so add a 'bus' parameter to the SPI interfaces. To avoid wasting
    time on AVR and CC1111 processors which only use one SPI bus, elide
    those parameters from the actual functions by wrapping them with
    macros.
    
    Configuring chip select is now all macroized so that each chip can
    have its own version, allowing the STM to share the various SPI device
    drivers with the cc1111 and avr processors. Note that only the M25
    driver has been ported; porting the others is 'trivial', but not
    necessary at this point.

    altos: Make ao_xmem funcs require __xdata void * instead of casting
    
    Having an explicit cast in the ao_xmem wrapper macros caused the
    compiler to generate garbage values for pdata addresses, making the
    upper byte 0x00 instead of the required 0xf0. Removing the
    casts from the ao_xmem macros exposed this problem, so a new
    PDATA_TO_XDATA macros was added, along with a CODE_TO_XDATA macro
    which serve to cast pointers, with suitable address modifications, so
    that things work again.

Date:   Sat Oct 8 22:19:52 2011 -0600

    altos: Improve TM v1.0 apogee estimate
    
    v1.0 boards have noisy accelerometer data caused by interactions
    between RF transmission and the accelerometer measurements; this noise
    generates a negative bias in the accelerometer readings. The net
    effect is that the estimated speed is lower than the actual speed,
    causing early an apogee estimate.
    
    By increasing the sigma value for accelerometer data, the kalman
    filter 'trusts' the acceleration data less, putting more weight on the
    barometer data. This causes the estimated time of apogee to be closer
    to the correct value.
    
    This reduces the response to changes in acceleration.
    
    This new value is applied solely to TeleMetrum v1.0 boards. v1.1
    boards correct for this error, and hence can use the correct sigma
    value for the accelerometer.

    TM and Tm go into idle mode if they receive a packet after boot
    time. When tebooting the device over the packet link, the packet
    master would be (rapidly) polling the device for additional data and
    so the device would invariably receive a packet during bootup and go
    into idle mode again.
    
    Delay the reboot by a second to give the controller time to disable
    the master end of the packet link.

    altos: Require sequencing through 'main' state before landing
    
    The old version of the code would permit the flight to go straight
    from 'drogue' to 'landed' without passing through 'main' at all. This
    meant that a false landing detection would leave the main charge
    unfired, potentially causing the airframe to land on drogue alone.
    
    Requiring that the flight sequence pass through main ensures that the
    main charge will get fired at the right time, although if the airframe
    lands higher than that altitude, it will not go to 'landed' mode ever.

    altos: Average height values for landing detection
    
    Instead of using the direct output of the kalman filter and hoping
    that is quiet enough to detect landing, filter that with a long
    exponential decay filter and then check to make sure that doesn't
    change more than 2m in 5 seconds as a trigger for landing detection.
    
    Tested with existing telemetrum flight logs and it correctly detects
    landing in all cases.

    altos: Complete new telemetry switchover
    
    This involved rewriting the GPS code to use the telemetry structures
    directly so that a memcpy could be used to transfer the data to the
    telemetry packets, saving a bunch of code space, along with fixing up
    the gps testing programs to deal with the structure changes.
    
    In addition, the teledongle code needed to have the monitoring code
    split into separate radio receiver and USB writer threads as the
    packets are now back-to-back, and hence come too fast to wait for the
    USB data to be sent to the host after each one.

    Flight state must be checked only after any pending data have been

    With the fixed kalman filter, transitions across mach don't cause
    bumps in the merged filter.
    
    And, with working kalman bits, the signal for broken baro detection is
    stronger and so we can allow for baro apogee detection in cases where
    noise occurs close to apogee.
    
    Bump the kalman filter to trust the baro less so that the model tracks
    across mach.

    altos: Split out tiny telemetry from full telemetry
    
    The TeleMini and TeleNano boards do not have either GPS or
    accelermeters, and they also run the kalman filter which produces
    standard unit measurements for the flight height/speed/accel
    values. This makes the telemetry significantly
    different. ao_telemetry_tiny.c sends the required data.
    
    Note that TeleNano sends the same telemetry as telemini at this point;
    there are a couple of values which are not useful, but the overhead of
    sending them is small enough that the hassle of having three telemetry
    formats seemed excessive.

    altos: Make telemetry interval more consistent
    
    Instead of using a delay between telemetry packets, use a telemetry
    period and compute an appropriate delay each time. This requires
    changing the ascent telemetry from a 50ms delay to a 100ms interval,
    to provide a regular 10 packets-per-second rate. Before, we counted on
    the telemetry packet taking about 50ms to send so that we would
    receive about 10 per second.
    
    This also eliminates delays during descent for RDF tones -- those will
    get transmitted in the interval between telemetry packets without
    interrupting the spacing of those packets.

    Oops. TeleDongle was starting the packet slave code, which kinda
    wrecked its ability to receive telemetry packets. This patch simply
    removes the packet slave code from teledongle as it cannot be used
    (yet), it also makes the packet slave code initialization take a
    parameter which controls whether to start that by default; in the
    future, perhaps TeleDongle will gain a command to start packet slave mode.

    When the 3.3V and 5V values shift relative to each other (usually due
    to changes in power consumption), the measured acceleration will

    value into a 5V referenced acceleration, eliminating this error.

    altos: clean up radio abort paths. Share radio code.
    
    Instead of aborting the DMA and radio operation and expecting that to
    be handled reasonably by the radio receiving task, rewrite things so
    that the abort function just wakes the receiving task while that
    terminates the DMA and cleans up the radio.
    
    This eliminates all kinds of nasty bugs dealing with radio abort
    smashing the radio registers at the wrong time, or interrupting a
    radio transmission.

    altosui: Only call swing display functions from main thread.
    
    Swing insists that all display functions be called from a single

    updates. Use SwingUtilities.invokeLater to make sure the flight UI

    altos: assume igniter worked.
    
    Many igniters don't go open when fired, so there's no way
    to know if they worked. Assume they did as a failed igniter is
    unlikely to do anything when fired again anyways.

    altosui: When fixing eeprom gps time information, make GPS data valid
    
    Eeprom files may be missing the GPS time (due to a firmware bug). Working
    around this involves finding the next valid GPS time and using that to
    create a fake GPS time entry. However, that next GPS time may not
    be locked or may have few sats as it is from the boost stage of the
    flight. Fix this by simply forcing the fake time packet to have
    4 sats and be locked.

    altosui: Open serial device at 'new' time. Prohibit duplicate opens.
    
    With the per-serial UI, there's never a reason to create a serial

    by not opening the serial device for telemetry reception.
    
    Serial devices can now be opened only once; this eliminates errors
    when trying to reflash or configure devices while receiving telemetry.

    altosui: Deal with eeprom dates going backwards across wrap
    
    eeprom timestamps can go backwards as the GPS time stamps are
    recorded when the first GPS character is received, but not placed into
    the eeprom log until the last GPS packet is complete. If this happens
    at the same time the tick count is wrapping, then the tick count will
    wrap backwards across the 0 boundary causing time to jump forwards.
    
    Fix this by letting time go backwards across the tick boundary, which
    requires that we know when the first 'real' tick is read from the
    eeprom file.

    altosui: Use recorded ground acceleration when reading eeprom files
    
    The flight software records 1000 accelerometer samples and records
    that in the flight log. Use that value instead of using the very few
    samples recorded in the eeprom before boost is detected. This
    generates far more accurate accerometer data in the .csv files.

    altosui: Fix up Mac OSX .zip file
    
    Must contain 'altosui.jar' instead of altosui-fat.jar.
    Also, was using 'cp -a' instead of 'cp -p' which made files
    represented by symlinks not end up in the archive.

    altosui: Allow 'connect to device' when already connected
    
    Opening another serial device involves shutting down the display
    thread (to reset its state) and spawning another one. Shutting down
    the display thread normally closes the serial device as a part of the
    process, and if this isn't done before the new serial device is
    opened, then the new serial device ends up getting closed too.
    
    Interrupting the display thread and waiting for it to stop before
    opening the new serial device solves the problem.

    altosui: Deal with altos bug setting radio channel while monitoring
    
    If the monitoring thread is active, then setting the radio channel can
    sometimes cause the monitoring thread to get stuck. I'm not entirely
    sure why though. For now, work around the issue by making sure
    monitoring is off, and the monitoring thread has stopped, before
    changing the radio channel.

    altos: shut down packet mode cleanly
    
    Instead of constantly bashing the packet master thread, let it shut
    itself down in an orderly fashion. It will shut down fairly quickly as
    all of the activities in that thread are bounded. Otherwise, the

    altos: Abort radio harder when terminating packet mode.
    
    Make sure the master radio tasks don't get stuck waiting for an
    incoming packet again by aborting the radio each time we poke the

    altosui: provide separate flush_input/flush_output for serial. deal with monitor automatically
    
    (yes, this should be two patches, but the diffs in AltosSerial were merged together).
    
    First, this replaces the existing flush/flush_reply mess with two simple functions,
    one to flush output to the serial device, making sure that all data written will be seen
    while we wait for input. The other sucks any pending input off of the serial line and
    discards it.
    
    Second, AltosSerial now tracks whether the serial line is being used for telemetry
    monitoring. If so, it enables monitoring, otherwise it disables it. Eliminates a
    bunch of manual state tracking elsewhere.

    We use replies in debug mode a lot and depend on them matching the
    expected parameters. The case which caused trouble was using
    TeleMetrum to reprogram TeleDongle -- sending the 'm 0' command (to
    disable telemetry monitoring on TeleDongle) to the TeleMetrum caused
    it to reply 'Syntax Error' which confused the subsequent flashing
    operation. Flushing that reply gets things back in sync.

    altos: Place rom config variables in fixed location
    
    The device serial number and radio calibration values are stored in
    flash, mostly so that TeleDongle gets them saved.
    
    Placing them in well-known locations (starting at 0xa0) makes it
    possible to find the previous configuration and to re-write it
    easily, without requiring the .map file.
    
    altosui doesn't have the .map file parsing code, so it relies upon
    this new technique. As a benefit, it reads the old values from the
    device before reprogramming it.

    Make ao_log_data re-entrant as it is used for both sensor and GPS logs
    
    Because ao_log_data is called from two different threads, failing to
    make it re-entrant would cause the 'log' pointer parameter to get
    overwritten if another thread asked to log data while the eeprom was
    busy writing out a block.
    
    This would cause the second thread to re-writing data from the first
    thread's address, but without re-checksumming the data as the checksum
    is computed before the log mutex is taken.
    
    The bug can be seen by log blocks with invalid checksums.
    
    Here's what happens with the ao_gps_tracking_report and ao_log threads:
    
      ao_gps_tracking_report		ao_log
    
       Writes a bunch of records
       *blocks* in the eeprom flush
    					sets ao_log_data 'log' to global 'log'
    					computes checksum for 'log' block
    					*blocks* on ao_log_mutex
       Wakes up
       sets ao_log_data 'log' to 'gps_log'
       writes remaining records
       'gps_log' is left with svid = 0
       *blocks* on ao_gps_tracking_data
    					writes data, reading from
    					the current ao_log_data 'log'
    					pointer which points at 'gps_log'
    
    Making ao_log_data re-entrant fixes this by ensuring that the 'ao_log'
    thread has its own copy of the ao_log_data 'log' parameter.
    
    I made this function take an __xdata restricted pointer so that it
    could be passed in the dptr register instead of needing to go on the stack.

    If you want to use TeleMetrum as a debug dongle, you need to flip the
    three pins used to talk to the remote debug port from SPI mode to GPIO
    mode.
    
    This patch doesn't provide any way to get back to SPI mode, so you'll

    Don't change dbg clock while changing reset_n. Use 20ms everywhere
    
    This changes the reset code to be more conservative about changing
    things at the same time, and also sets all timings to 20ms to make
    debugging with the scope easier.

    Disable interrupts while reading from stdin
    
    With multiple input source support, there is a lag between asking a
    device if it has data and then waiting for more data to appear. If an
    interrupt signalling additional input arrives in this interval, we'll
    go to sleep with input available.
    
    This patch uses a big hammer by just disabling interrupts for the
    whole process.

    Only have the slave return a packet if it received one.
    
    When the receive is aborted to switch modes, it's important to not
    immediately re-acquire the radio and try to send a packet as the
    aborting thread won't know to kick the receiver again.
    
    This prevents the 'C' command from locking up as it tries to stop the
    packet slave before turning on the transmitter.

    When changing RESET line, delay 20ms
    
    The GPS data sheet suggests a 1uF cap on the reset line to ensure it
    is held low long enough for the power supply to come up to voltage. TM
    v1.0 loads a 0.001uF cap there, but in case that isn't large enough,
    it could be replaced with the larger one. This change makes sure that
    even with that larger value, the debugging link will be able to reset
    the target.

    Attempting to abort a radio operation could lead to a hang if the user

    attempting to abort woke up. This change just keeps smacking the radio

    Round radio calibration value instead of truncating
    
    The radio calibration function in the bring-up code was truncating the
    radio calibration value which caused the resulting frequency to
    always measure above the target frequency, instead of trying to get as
    close as possible. This change will result in a closer frequency
    match, but may sometimes be below the target frequency.

    Eliminate deadlock when writing config from radio link
    
    Writing the 'Saved\r\n' string would fill the packet buffer and cause
    a flush to occur, which would need to wait for the radio link to
    receive and transmit a packet. The radio link always re-fetches the
    radio channel number when lighting up the radio, so it need to look in
    the config space. If the config mutex was held by the config writing
    process while the radio was trying to get the channel number, then
    we'd get a deadlock.

    Explicitly use USB I/O routines in packet code
    
    Using the implicit stdio functions (putchar/getchar/flush) would
    result in essentially random redirection of each, depending on whether
    the packet code had characters available when getchar was called. This
    would cause lockups in putchar.

    In USB pollchar, wait for packet before re-checking USB out len
    
    This probably wouldn't actually cause a problem, but it seems more
    reliable to wait for a packet interrupt before re-reading the packet
    OUT len register. This could avoid spinning while waiting for a USB
    packet, which seems like a good thing.

    In packet master, move USB flush from packet thread to echo thread
    
    This keeps the packet thread from blocking on USB and also makes the
    flush happen after every packet (slightly more USB traffic, but
    packets are slow anyway).

    Pass accel calibration over telemetry stream. Telemetry data format change.
    
    This allows the ground station to convert the accelerometer sensor
    values into acceleration and speed data. This requires a new telemetry
    data structure, and so TeleMetrum and TeleDongle units must be updated
    synchronously. ao-view will parse either telemetry stream, and the
    serial format from TeleDongle now has a version number to allow for
    future changes.

    Add two-point accelerometer calibration.
    
    Calibration now uses two values, one upside right and the other upside
    down instead of a single horizontal value. This allows the use of
    other accelerometers and compensates for variations in the divider
    circuit to provide more accurate data.

    Make RDF beacon only run on pad and after landing.
    
    It's pretty much impossible to RDF the rocket during flight, and it
    interferes with the telemetry data stream. Leave it enabled on the pad
    so that radios can be tested, and then re-enable it once the rocket
    has landed.
    
    This patch also turns the rdf 'on' time into a parameter so it can be
    changed, and then sets that parameter to 500ms, once every 5 seconds.

    Communication with the CP2103 board has gone through three revisions,
    first using ioctls supported by the CP2103 kernel driver, then using
    the old synchronous usb library and now using the newer libusb
    asynchronous interface. There's no reason to keep shipping the old
    stale code now that the new stuff works reliably.

    Convert GPS to SiRF binary protocol.
    
    This switches the GPS unit from NMEA to SiRF protocol at startup and then
    parses the binary data. The binary data uses a different encoding of lat/lon
    than the NMEA strings, and so the telemetry and eeprom data formats change
    with this switch.

    While on the pad, zero out velocity every second
    
    We integrate acceleration to get velocity, but that means sitting on the pad
    for a long time can add substantial error to the velocity value. Each
    second, take the velocity value from a full second ago and subtract that out
    of the current velocity. Once we detect boost, this will stop, which means
    that as long as we detect boost within a second, we won't have subtracted
    out any "real" velocity.
    
    This keeps the pad velocity hovering around zero, which is pretty useful.

    Accelerometer-based velocity values are invalid after apogee
    
    Because the orientation of the flight computer relative to the ground is
    unknown after apogee, the accelerometer data cannot be integrated to compute
    velocity. Main deploy is now based purely on barometric altitude and landing
    detection no longer checks for a low velocity value.

    Add velocity check for boost detect via accelerometer
    
    Bumping the rocket can cause a brief period of high acceleration, which may
    cause a mistaken boost detection. Require both a high acceleration and
    reasonable velocity to trigger boost phase.

    The average accelerometer value cannot be extracted from the log as the
    record starts after that is computed. As that drives much of the
    accelerometer-based state transition logic, it is an important value to
    have, so we log it as part of the flight start record now.

    Ok, way too big a patch, but things were in rough shape.
    This patch adds support for the radio, both transmit and receive.
    Then, because I could no longer run the TeleMetrum code on the TI

    involved creating a mechanism for having multiple command sets and splitting
    code for different functions into different files.

    Add simple test program to light up the transmitter at 434.550MHz
    
    This starts a transmit sequence, but doesn't send any data so the
    transmitter just locks on.

    Wait for a while when switching the RESET_N line
    
    The cc1111 manual suggests placing a 2.7kΩ resister and 1nF capacitor on the
    RESET_N line to filter out noise. This increases the time necessary to reset
    the chip to several microseconds which is longer than the interval between
    two USB packets. Flush the USB packet queue and sleep for a while after
    changing the value on the RESET_N line to make sure the chip sees the state
    change.

    Save/restore registers to host during memory operations. Cache ROM data.
    
    Because the debug port uses instructions for most operations, the debug code
    will clobber registers used by the running program. Save and restore these
    to avoid corrupting application data.
    
    If the ROM file is known, use that to return data instead of fetching it
    from the target to improve performance.

    Save/restore regs when reading/writing memory. Add SFR access.
    
    The DPL and ACC registers are used by the memory access code,

    this should probably be fixed to pull them back to the host instead.
