.TH AO-LOAD 1 "ao-usbload" ""
.SH NAME
ao-usbload \- flash a program to an ARM-based AltOS device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ao-usbload"
[\-T \fItty-device\fP]
[\--tty \fItty-device\fP]
[\-D \fIaltos-device\fP]
[\--device \fIaltos-device\fP]
[\--cal \fIradio-calibration\fP]
[\--serial \fserial-number\fP]
\fIfile.elf\fP or \fIfile.ihx\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ao-usbload
loads the specified .elf or .ihx file into the target device flash
memory via the AltOS boot loader, using either existing serial number
and radio calibration values or taking either of those from the
command line.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-T tty-device | --tty tty-device
This selects which tty device the debugger uses to communicate with
the target device. The special name 'BITBANG' directs ao-dbg to use
the cp2103 connection, otherwise this should be a usb serial port
connected to a suitable cc1111 debug node.
.TP
\-D AltOS-device | --device AltOS-device
Search for a connected device. This requires an argument of one of the
following forms:
.IP
TeleMega:2
.br
TeleMega
.br
2
.IP
Leaving out the product name will cause the tool to select a suitable
product, leaving out the serial number will cause the tool to match
one of the available devices.
.TP
\-s serial-number | --serial serial-number
This programs the device serial number into the image. If no serial
number is specified, then the existing serial number, if any, will be
read from the device.
.TP
\-c radio-calibration | --cal radio-calibration This programs the
radio calibration value into the image for hardware which doesn't have
any eeprom storage for this value. If no calibration value is
specified, an existing calibration value will be used. The value here
can be computed given the current radio calibration value, the
measured frequency and the desired frequency:
.IP
	cal' = cal * (desired/measured)
.IP
The default calibration value is 7119667.
.SH USAGE
.I ao-usbload
reads the specified .elf file into memory, edits the image to
customize it using the specified serial number and radio calibration
values. It then connects to the debug dongle and writes the program to
the target device flash memory.
