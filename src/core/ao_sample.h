 * Barometer calibration
 *
 * We directly sample the barometer. The specs say:
 *
 * Pressure range: 15-115 kPa
 * Voltage at 115kPa: 2.82
 * Output scale: 27mV/kPa
 *
 * If we want to detect launch with the barometer, we need
 * a large enough bump to not be fooled by noise. At typical
 * launch elevations (0-2000m), a 200Pa pressure change cooresponds
 * to about a 20m elevation change. This is 5.4mV, or about 3LSB.
 * As all of our calculations are done in 16 bits, we'll actually see a change
 * of 16 times this though
 *
 * 27 mV/kPa * 32767 / 3300 counts/mV = 268.1 counts/kPa
 */

/* Accelerometer calibration
 *
 * We're sampling the accelerometer through a resistor divider which
 * consists of 5k and 10k resistors. This multiplies the values by 2/3.
 * That goes into the cc1111 A/D converter, which is running at 11 bits
 * of precision with the bits in the MSB of the 16 bit value. Only positive
 * values are used, so values should range from 0-32752 for 0-3.3V. The
 * specs say we should see 40mV/g (uncalibrated), multiply by 2/3 for what
 * the A/D converter sees (26.67 mV/g). We should see 32752/3300 counts/mV,
 * for a final computation of:
 *
 * 26.67 mV/g * 32767/3300 counts/mV = 264.8 counts/g
 *
 * Zero g was measured at 16000 (we would expect 16384).
 * Note that this value is only require to tell if the
 * rocket is standing upright. Once that is determined,
 * the value of the accelerometer is averaged for 100 samples
 * to find the resting accelerometer value, which is used
 * for all further flight computations
