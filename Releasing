These are Bdale's notes on how to do a release.

	git checkout master

	- make sure there is a doc/release-notes-<version>.xsl
	- make sure that doc/altusmetrum.xsl has the right copyright year,
	  and add release to the revision history at the front (release notes
	  will be pulled in automatically)

	- update the version in configure.ac
        git log > ChangeLog
	git commit -a

	- make absolutely sure checked-out tree is "clean" 
	- make absolutely sure the pdclib/ submodule is on the master branch,
	  up to date, and "clean"

	- if this is an x.y release, then:
		git checkout -b branch-<version>
		git tag -a <version>
		- edit .git/gbp.conf to use branch-<version> as upstream

	- if this is an x.y.z release, then:
		git checkout branch-<version>		# the x.y parts only
		git merge master
		git tag -a <version>			# full x.y.z version

	git checkout debian
	git merge branch-<version>

	- verify debian/changelog is "clean" ending in last release version
	- craft a suitable debian/changelog entry, possibly using:
	git-dch --release --new-version=<version>-1 --multimaint-merge

        git commit -n debian/changelog -m "update changelog for Debian build"

	- if this is a -1 release, then
		git-buildpackage --git-no-pristine-tar --git-submodules \
			--git-upstream-branch=branch-<version>
		pristine-tar commit \
			../build-area/altos_<version>.orig.tar.gz \
			branch-<version>
	  else if this is not a -1 release
		git-buildpackage --git-submodules

	git tag debian/<version>

	- at this point we have packages in ~/debian/build-area/altos, now
	  we move on to the non-Debian part of the release process

	make distclean

	./autogen.sh --with-fat-dir=/home/bdale/web/altusmetrum/AltOS/releases
	make && make fat

		this pushes packages for each platform to web site

	- copy the relevant release notes file from doc/ to 
	    /home/bdale/web/altusmetrum/AltOS/releases/<rev>

	- create /home/bdale/web/altusmetrum/MicroPeak/releases/<rev>,
	  and move the MicroPeak installers from AltOS/releases to there
		
	- go edit ~/web/altusmetrum/AltOS/releases/<rev>.mdwn and 
	  /home/bdale/web/altusmetrum/MicroPeak/releases/<rev>.mdwn, to 
	  include release date and explicit ref to dir contents so the 
	  web pages shows versioned links, commit and push

	(cd doc ; make publish)

		this pushes fresh documents to the web site

	sudo debian/rules clean
	git push origin master branch-<version> debian
	git push --tags

		push commits and leave the build tree in an uncluttered state

Testing before a release

	To verify that a build works, the following need to be checked
	on each platform:

	1) Install package

	2) Connect TM *and* TD devices. Verify that you can Monitor
	   Flight from the TD and Configure Telemetrum from the TM.

	3) Replay Flight, using your favorite .eeprom file. Check
	   each tab, especially the 'Site Map' tab. Make sure the
	   sound works.

	4) Graph Data. Graph a favorite .eeprom file. Make sure you
	   can zoom in on some region of the graph.
