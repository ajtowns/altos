.TH AO-LOAD 1 "ao-stmload" ""
.SH NAME
ao-stmload \- flash a program to an STM32-based AltOS device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ao-stmload"
[\-D \fI/dev/sgX\fP]
[\--device \fI/dev/sgX\fP]
[\--cal \fIradio-calibration\fP]
[\--serial \fserial-number\fP]
\fIfile.elf\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ao-stmload
loads the specified .elf file into the target device flash memory,
using either existing serial number and radio calibration values or
taking either of those from the command line.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-D /dev/sgX | --device /dev/sgX
This targets an STlinkV1 connection rather than STlinkV2
.TP
\-s serial-number | --serial serial-number
This programs the device serial number into the image. If no serial
number is specified, then the existing serial number, if any, will be
read from the device.
.TP
\-c radio-calibration | --cal radio-calibration This programs the
radio calibration value into the image for hardware which doesn't have
any eeprom storage for this value. If no calibration value is
specified, an existing calibration value will be used. The value here
can be computed given the current radio calibration value, the
measured frequency and the desired frequency:
.IP
	cal' = cal * (desired/measured)
.IP
The default calibration value is 7119667.
.SH USAGE
.I ao-stmload
reads the specified .elf file into memory, edits the image to
customize it using the specified serial number and radio calibration
values. It then connects to the debug dongle and writes the program to
the target device flash memory.
