These are Bdale's notes on how to do a release.

	update the version in configure.ac and commit

	git tag -a <version>

	git-buildpackage --git-ignore-new

		use --git-ignore-new so trash in checked-out tree doesn't
		cause the build to fail!

		at this point, we have Debian packages

	make distclean

	./autogen.sh --with-fat-dir=/home/bdale/web/altusmetrum/AltOS/releases
	make fat

		this pushes packages for each platform to web site

	- go edit ~/web/altusmetrum/AltOS/releases/<rev>.mdwn to include
	  release date and explicit ref to dir contents so the AltOS page
	  shows versioned links, commit and push

	(cd doc ; make publish)

		this pushes fresh documents to the web site

Testing before a release

	To verify that a build works, the following need to be checked
	on each platform:

	1) Install package

	2) Connect TM *and* TD devices. Verify that you can Monitor
	   Flight from the TD and Configure Telemetrum from the TM.

	3) Replay Flight, using your favorite .eeprom file. Check
	   each tab, especially the 'Site Map' tab. Make sure the
	   sound works.

	4) Graph Data. Graph a favorite .eeprom file. Make sure you
	   can zoom in on some region of the graph.
