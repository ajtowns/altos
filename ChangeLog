    Don't change dbg clock while changing reset_n. Use 20ms everywhere
    
    This changes the reset code to be more conservative about changing
    things at the same time, and also sets all timings to 20ms to make
    debugging with the scope easier.

    Disable interrupts while reading from stdin
    
    With multiple input source support, there is a lag between asking a
    device if it has data and then waiting for more data to appear. If an
    interrupt signalling additional input arrives in this interval, we'll
    go to sleep with input available.
    
    This patch uses a big hammer by just disabling interrupts for the
    whole process.

    Only have the slave return a packet if it received one.
    
    When the receive is aborted to switch modes, it's important to not
    immediately re-acquire the radio and try to send a packet as the
    aborting thread won't know to kick the receiver again.
    
    This prevents the 'C' command from locking up as it tries to stop the
    packet slave before turning on the transmitter.

    When changing RESET line, delay 20ms
    
    The GPS data sheet suggests a 1uF cap on the reset line to ensure it
    is held low long enough for the power supply to come up to voltage. TM
    v1.0 loads a 0.001uF cap there, but in case that isn't large enough,
    it could be replaced with the larger one. This change makes sure that
    even with that larger value, the debugging link will be able to reset
    the target.

    Attempting to abort a radio operation could lead to a hang if the user

    attempting to abort woke up. This change just keeps smacking the radio
    until the radio goes idle long enough to detect it.

    Round radio calibration value instead of truncating
    
    The radio calibration function in the bring-up code was truncating the
    radio calibration value which caused the resulting frequency to
    always measure above the target frequency, instead of trying to get as
    close as possible. This change will result in a closer frequency
    match, but may sometimes be below the target frequency.

    Eliminate deadlock when writing config from radio link
    
    Writing the 'Saved\r\n' string would fill the packet buffer and cause
    a flush to occur, which would need to wait for the radio link to
    receive and transmit a packet. The radio link always re-fetches the
    radio channel number when lighting up the radio, so it need to look in
    the config space. If the config mutex was held by the config writing
    process while the radio was trying to get the channel number, then
    we'd get a deadlock.

    Any pending input would just confuse the application, so pull it off
    the link and dump it.

    Explicitly use USB I/O routines in packet code
    
    Using the implicit stdio functions (putchar/getchar/flush) would
    result in essentially random redirection of each, depending on whether
    the packet code had characters available when getchar was called. This
    would cause lockups in putchar.

    In USB pollchar, wait for packet before re-checking USB out len
    
    This probably wouldn't actually cause a problem, but it seems more
    reliable to wait for a packet interrupt before re-reading the packet
    OUT len register. This could avoid spinning while waiting for a USB
    packet, which seems like a good thing.

    In packet master, move USB flush from packet thread to echo thread
    
    This keeps the packet thread from blocking on USB and also makes the
    flush happen after every packet (slightly more USB traffic, but
    packets are slow anyway).

    Pass accel calibration over telemetry stream. Telemetry data format change.
    
    This allows the ground station to convert the accelerometer sensor
    values into acceleration and speed data. This requires a new telemetry
    data structure, and so TeleMetrum and TeleDongle units must be updated
    synchronously. ao-view will parse either telemetry stream, and the
    serial format from TeleDongle now has a version number to allow for
    future changes.

    Add two-point accelerometer calibration.
    
    Calibration now uses two values, one upside right and the other upside
    down instead of a single horizontal value. This allows the use of
    other accelerometers and compensates for variations in the divider
    circuit to provide more accurate data.

    Make RDF beacon only run on pad and after landing.
    
    It's pretty much impossible to RDF the rocket during flight, and it
    interferes with the telemetry data stream. Leave it enabled on the pad
    so that radios can be tested, and then re-enable it once the rocket
    has landed.
    
    This patch also turns the rdf 'on' time into a parameter so it can be
    changed, and then sets that parameter to 500ms, once every 5 seconds.

    Communication with the CP2103 board has gone through three revisions,
    first using ioctls supported by the CP2103 kernel driver, then using
    the old synchronous usb library and now using the newer libusb
    asynchronous interface. There's no reason to keep shipping the old
    stale code now that the new stuff works reliably.

    parses the binary data. The binary data uses a different encoding of lat/lon
    than the NMEA strings, and so the telemetry and eeprom data formats change
    with this switch.

    None of our boards have a 32kHz xtal oscillator, instead we use those pins
    (on Telemetrum) for the deployment firing circuits. The old clock
    initialization code was switching from the 32kHz RC oscillator to the 32kHz
    crystal and overriding our use of those pins.

    While on the pad, zero out velocity every second
    
    We integrate acceleration to get velocity, but that means sitting on the pad
    for a long time can add substantial error to the velocity value. Each
    second, take the velocity value from a full second ago and subtract that out
    of the current velocity. Once we detect boost, this will stop, which means
    that as long as we detect boost within a second, we won't have subtracted
    out any "real" velocity.
    
    This keeps the pad velocity hovering around zero, which is pretty useful.

    Use recorded accelerometer baseline data in ao_flight_test
    
    With the flight computer recording a long-term average value for the
    accelerometer in the flight record, use that to prime the flight test code
    when running a log file through the simulator.

    Don't re-initialize the landing range data at each apogee detect sample
    
    The landing range values are used only after apogee detect, so we need only
    initialize them on the transition from apogee to drogue.

    Initialize ao_min_vel with |ao_flight_vel|
    
    As ao_min_vel is stored as an absolute value, it's important to preserve
    that invariant, even though we don't expect ao_flight_vel to be negative at
    coast.

    Decrease telemetry rate on the pad to 1/sec instead of 20/sec
    
    Transmitting telemetry through the radio consumes a significant amount of
    battery; reducing the rate to 1/sec will reduce power usage while waiting
    for launch.

    Record average accelerometer value in flight start log record
    
    The average accelerometer value cannot be extracted from the log as the
    record starts after that is computed. As that drives much of the
    accelerometer-based state transition logic, it is an important value to
    have, so we log it as part of the flight start record now.

    Add radio support. Build separate executables for TeleMetrum and the TI dongle
    
    Ok, way too big a patch, but things were in rough shape.
    This patch adds support for the radio, both transmit and receive.
    Then, because I could no longer run the TeleMetrum code on the TI
    dongle, I ended up building a separate image for the TI board, which
    involved creating a mechanism for having multiple command sets and splitting
    code for different functions into different files.

    Wait for a while when switching the RESET_N line
    
    The cc1111 manual suggests placing a 2.7kΩ resister and 1nF capacitor on the
    RESET_N line to filter out noise. This increases the time necessary to reset
    the chip to several microseconds which is longer than the interval between
    two USB packets. Flush the USB packet queue and sleep for a while after
    changing the value on the RESET_N line to make sure the chip sees the state
    change.

    Save/restore registers to host during memory operations. Cache ROM data.
    
    Because the debug port uses instructions for most operations, the debug code
    will clobber registers used by the running program. Save and restore these
    to avoid corrupting application data.
    
    If the ROM file is known, use that to return data instead of fetching it
    from the target to improve performance.

    Save/restore regs when reading/writing memory. Add SFR access.
    
    The DPL and ACC registers are used by the memory access code,
    so they need to be saved and restored. Stuff them up high in ram for now;
    this should probably be fixed to pull them back to the host instead.
    
    Special SFR access is required as not all SFRs are visible in the unified

    sdcdb provides source-level debugging using the 8051 emulator, s51. By
