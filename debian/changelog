  * Add two-point accelerometer calibration.
  * Remove "l" command as ao-dumplong no longer uses it
  * Remove "d" command
  * Remove "f" command
  * Reformat ADC values to show all 16 bits
  * ao_flight_test was using accel value for pressure too
  * Pass accel calibration over telemetry stream. Telemetry data format
    change.
  * Add ability to dump eeprom data over radio link.
  * In packet master, move USB flush from packet thread to echo thread
  * In USB pollchar, wait for packet before re-checking USB out len
  * Explicitly use USB I/O routines in packet code
  * Flush pending input when switching to remote packet mode
  * Stop recording in ao-dumplog after receiving an invalid block
  * Move ao_match_word from ao_ignite.c to ao_cmd.c
  * Add Watchdog Timer Control register definitions
  * Add reboot command.
  * Return radio to telemetry settings when packet system closed.
  * ao-postflight: fix sloppy gps sat data realloc code (was crashing).
  * Loosen tolerances for main->landed transition
  * Provide a dummy 'uninstall' target in the src directory.
  * Share telemetry parsing code in cc library.
  * Enable telemetry receive in ao_view
  * Switch order of serial/flight in ao-postflight summary
  * Add flight number to telemetry stream.
