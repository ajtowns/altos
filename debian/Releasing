These are Bdale's notes on how to do a release.

	update the version in configure.ac and commit
	
	git tag -a <version>

	git-buildpackage --git-ignore-new

		use --git-ignore-new so trash in checked-out tree doesn't
		cause the build to fail!

		at this point, we have Debian packages

	make distclean

	./autogen.sh --with-fat-dir=/home/bdale/web/altusmetrum/AltOS/releases
	make fat

		this pushes packages for each platform to web site

	- go edit ~/web/altusmetrum/AltOS/releases/<rev>.mdwn to include
	  release date and explicit ref to dir contents so the AltOS page
	  shows versioned links, commit and push

	(cd doc ; make publish)

		this pushes fresh documents to the web site
