These are Bdale's notes on how to do a release.

	update the version in configure.ac and commit

	git tag -a <version>

	- make sure checked-out tree is "clean" so git won't complain

	git-buildpackage

		at this point, we have Debian packages

	git tag debian/<version>

	make distclean

	./autogen.sh --with-fat-dir=/home/bdale/web/altusmetrum/AltOS/releases
	make fat

		this pushes packages for each platform to web site

	- copy the relevant release notes file from doc/ to 
	    /home/bdale/web/altusmetrum/AltOS/releases/<rev>

	- go edit ~/web/altusmetrum/AltOS/releases/<rev>.mdwn to include
	  release date and explicit ref to dir contents so the AltOS page
	  shows versioned links, commit and push

	(cd doc ; make publish)

		this pushes fresh documents to the web site

	sudo debian/rules clean
	git push
	git push --tags

		push commits and leave the build tree in an uncluttered state

Testing before a release

	To verify that a build works, the following need to be checked
	on each platform:

	1) Install package

	2) Connect TM *and* TD devices. Verify that you can Monitor
	   Flight from the TD and Configure Telemetrum from the TM.

	3) Replay Flight, using your favorite .eeprom file. Check
	   each tab, especially the 'Site Map' tab. Make sure the
	   sound works.

	4) Graph Data. Graph a favorite .eeprom file. Make sure you
	   can zoom in on some region of the graph.
