Desired AltosDroid feature list

 *) GPS satellite status tab. Monitor GPS C/N0 numbers and
    SVIDs. Provides more info before GPS lock is acquired.

 *) Channel scanning. Provide the ability to search for telemetry
    signals like AltosUI does.

 *) Highlight current frequency in the frequency list.

 *) Random frequency selection. Provide some mechanism to input
    arbitrary radio frequencies. Could be like AltosUI which allows
    you to edit the list of frequencies and assign names to them,
    or perhaps something better.
  
 *) TM configuration from the droid

 *) Monitor-idle mode

 *) Frequency scanning

 *) Select satellite imaging mode

 *) Remember most-recently-used TBT and frequency, perhaps
    auto-connect at startup.
    
 *) Re-loading flight data from .telem file to get back to
    'find my rocket' mode after shutting down the application.

 *) Imperial Units mode

 *) TeleBT battery voltage
