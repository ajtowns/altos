These are Bdale's notes on how to do a release.

	git checkout master
	- update the version in configure.ac
        git log > ChangeLog
	git commit -a
	- make absolutely sure checked-out tree is "clean" 
	- if this is an x.y release, then:
		git checkout -b branch-<version>
		git tag -a <version>
	- if this is an x.y.z release, then:
		git checkout branch-<version>		# the x.y parts only
		git merge master
		git tag -a <version>			# full x.y.z version

	- edit .git/gbp.conf to use branch-<version> as upstream if needed

	git checkout debian
	git merge branch-<version>

	- verify debian/changelog is "clean" ending in last release version
	- craft a suitable debian/changelog entry, possibly using:
	git-dch --release --new-version=<version>-1 --multimaint-merge

        git commit -n debian/changelog -m "update changelog for Debian build"

	git-buildpackage --git-no-pristine-tar 
	pristine-tar commit ../build-area/altos/altos_<version>.orig.tar.gz
	git tag debian/<version>

	- at this point we have packages in ~/debian/build-area/altos, now
	  we move on to the non-Debian part of the release process

	make distclean

	./autogen.sh --with-fat-dir=/home/bdale/web/altusmetrum/AltOS/releases
	make && make fat

		this pushes packages for each platform to web site

	- copy the relevant release notes file from doc/ to 
	    /home/bdale/web/altusmetrum/AltOS/releases/<rev>

	- go edit ~/web/altusmetrum/AltOS/releases/<rev>.mdwn to include
	  release date and explicit ref to dir contents so the AltOS page
	  shows versioned links, commit and push

	(cd doc ; make publish)

		this pushes fresh documents to the web site

	sudo debian/rules clean
	git push
	git push --tags

		push commits and leave the build tree in an uncluttered state

Testing before a release

	To verify that a build works, the following need to be checked
	on each platform:

	1) Install package

	2) Connect TM *and* TD devices. Verify that you can Monitor
	   Flight from the TD and Configure Telemetrum from the TM.

	3) Replay Flight, using your favorite .eeprom file. Check
	   each tab, especially the 'Site Map' tab. Make sure the
	   sound works.

	4) Graph Data. Graph a favorite .eeprom file. Make sure you
	   can zoom in on some region of the graph.
