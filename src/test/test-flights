2010-08-21-serial-010-flight-007.eeprom Robert's Lil Nuke, flying on a CTI Pro29 2-grain 110G250 Vmax. Just awesome!  PFND.
2010-08-21-serial-224-flight-004.eeprom Anthony Towns' LDDD clone, successful L1 cert on a CTI Pro38 2-grain 266H125 classic.  Airframe was set up for apogee-only with motor based ejection.  The BP charge was larger than necessary, caused nose cone to snap back against aft airframe.  Minor damage to leading edge of aft airframe, big chunk of the nose cone skin cracked away.  Same problem Bdale saw on Sharp Stick's nosecone, also from Performance Rocketry, where there was apparently an air bubble below the gel coat.  Determination was that damage was cosmetic and would not affect cert... confirmed by successful L2 later in the day!
2010-08-21-serial-224-flight-005.eeprom Anthony Towns' LDDD clone, successful L2 cert on a CTI Pro38 5-grain 58J357 blue streak.  Perfect drogueless dual deploy!  0.8-0.9 grams aft charge and about 1.0 grams forward.  Flew without ground testing charges due to time pressure before waiver closed for the day.  About as close to the waiver as you'd ever want to be on a cert flight, again demonstrating that OpenRocket under-estimates apogee ... approximately 6800 ft predicted...
2010-08-21-serial-233-flight-002.eeprom Tim van Milligan's 5.5" L2 airframe, flying on a CTI Pro38 6-grain 774J410 red, TM indicated a problem with the apogee igniter continuity, noticed during countdown, turned out to be a loose wire!  Perfect dual deploy flight once that was fixed.
2010-09-03-serial-051-flight-005.eeprom G-spot on an old Aerotech H125-20W single use 29mm motor.  It appears the ejection at apogee actually happened much later, perhaps as much as 10 seconds late!
2010-09-03-serial-215-flight-005.eeprom Horizon Rebuild on a K490 Green3 reload.  PFND. About 1.4 grams each end. (accel noise fools full)
