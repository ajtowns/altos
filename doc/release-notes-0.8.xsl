    <listitem>
<para>
      Post-flight graphing tool. This lets you explore the behaviour
      of your rocket after flight with a scroll-able and zoom-able
      chart showing the altitude, speed and acceleration of the
      airframe along with events recorded by the flight computer. You
      can export graphs to PNG files, or print them directly.
    </para>

    <listitem>
<para>
      Real-time moving map which overlays the in-progress flight on
      satellite imagery fetched from Google Maps. This lets you see in
      pictures where your rocket has landed, allowing you to plan
      recovery activities more accurately.
    </para>

    <listitem>
<para>
      Wireless recovery system testing. Prep your rocket for flight
      and test fire the deployment charges to make sure things work as
      expected. All without threading wires through holes in your
      airframe.
    </para>

<para>
      Optimized flight status displays. Each flight state now has it's
      own custom 'tab' in the flight monitoring window so you can
      focus on the most important details. Pre-flight, the system
      shows a set of red/green status indicators for battery voltage,
      apogee/main igniter continutity and GPS reception. Wait until
      they're all green and your rocket is ready for flight. There are
      also tabs for ascent, descent and landing along with the
      original tabular view of the data.
    </para>
</listitem>
    <listitem>
<para>
      Monitor multiple flights simultaneously. If you have more than
      one TeleDongle, you can monitor a flight with each one on the
      same computer.
    </para>
</listitem>
    <listitem>
<para>
      Automatic flight monitoring at startup. Plug TeleDongle into the
      machine before starting AltosUI and it will automatically
      connect to it and prepare to monitor a flight.
    </para>
</listitem>
    <listitem>
<para>
      Exports Google Earth flight tracks. Using the Keyhole Markup
      Language (.kml) file format, this provides a 3D view of your
      rocket flight through the Google Earth program.
