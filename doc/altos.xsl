    <para>
      AltOS is a operating system built for the 8051-compatible
      processor found in the TI cc1111 microcontroller. It's designed
      to be small and easy to program with. The main features are:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Multi-tasking. While the 8051 doesn't provide separate
	  address spaces, it's often easier to write code that operates
	  in separate threads instead of tying everything into one giant
	  event loop.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Non-preemptive. This increases latency for thread
	  switching but reduces the number of places where context
	  switching can occur. It also simplifies the operating system
	  design somewhat. Nothing in the target system (rocket flight
	  control) has tight timing requirements, and so this seems like
	  a reasonable compromise.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Sleep/wakeup scheduling. Taken directly from ancient
	  Unix designs, these two provide the fundemental scheduling
	  primitive within AltOS.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Mutexes. As a locking primitive, mutexes are easier to
	  use than semaphores, at least in my experience.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Timers. Tasks can set an alarm which will abort any
	  pending sleep, allowing operations to time-out instead of
	  blocking forever.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      The device drivers and other subsystems in AltOS are
      conventionally enabled by invoking their _init() function from
      the 'main' function before that calls
      ao_start_scheduler(). These functions initialize the pin
      assignments, add various commands to the command processor and
      may add tasks to the scheduler to handle the device. A typical
      main program, thus, looks like:
      <programlisting>
	void
	main(void)
	{
	        ao_clock_init();

	        /* Turn on the LED until the system is stable */
	        ao_led_init(LEDS_AVAILABLE);
	        ao_led_on(AO_LED_RED);
	        ao_timer_init();
	        ao_cmd_init();
	        ao_usb_init();
	        ao_monitor_init(AO_LED_GREEN, TRUE);
	        ao_rssi_init(AO_LED_RED);
	        ao_radio_init();
	        ao_packet_slave_init();
	        ao_packet_master_init();
	        #if HAS_DBG
	        ao_dbg_init();
	        #endif
	        ao_config_init();
	        ao_start_scheduler();
	}
      </programlisting>
      As you can see, a long sequence of subsystems are initialized
      and then the scheduler is started.

    <title>Programming the 8051 with SDCC</title>
    <para>
      The 8051 is a primitive 8-bit processor, designed in the mists
      of time in as few transistors as possible. The architecture is
      highly irregular and includes several separate memory
      spaces. Furthermore, accessing stack variables is slow, and the
      stack itself is of limited size. While SDCC papers over the
      instruction set, it is not completely able to hide the memory
      architecture from the application designer.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>8051 memory spaces</title>
      <para>
	The __data/__xdata/__code memory spaces below were completely
	separate in the original 8051 design. In the cc1111, this
	isn't trueâ€”they all live in a single unified 64kB address
	space, and so it's possible to convert any address into a
	unique 16-bit address. SDCC doesn't know this, and so a
	'global' address to SDCC consumes 3 bytes of memory, 1 byte as
	a tag indicating the memory space and 2 bytes of offset within
	that space. AltOS avoids these 3-byte addresses as much as
	possible; using them involves a function call per byte
	access. The result is that nearly every variable declaration
	is decorated with a memory space identifier which clutters the
	code but makes the resulting code far smaller and more
	efficient.
      </para>
      <section>
	<title>__data</title>
	<para>
	  The 8051 can directly address these 128 bytes of
	  memory. This makes them precious so they should be
	  reserved for frequently addressed values. Oh, just to
	  confuse things further, the 8 general registers in the
	  CPU are actually stored in this memory space. There are
	  magic instructions to 'bank switch' among 4 banks of
	  these registers located at 0x00 - 0x1F. AltOS uses only
	  the first bank at 0x00 - 0x07, leaving the other 24
	  bytes available for other data.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>__idata</title>
	<para>
	  There are an additional 128 bytes of internal memory
	  that share the same address space as __data but which
	  cannot be directly addressed. The stack normally
	  occupies this space and so AltOS doesn't place any
	  static storage here.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>__xdata</title>
	<para>
	  This is additional general memory accessed through a
	  single 16-bit address register. The CC1111F32 has 32kB
	  of memory available here. Most program data should live
	  in this memory space.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>__pdata</title>
	<para>
	  This is an alias for the first 256 bytes of __xdata
	  memory, but uses a shorter addressing mode with
	  single global 8-bit value for the high 8 bits of the
	  address and any of several 8-bit registers for the low 8
	  bits. AltOS uses a few bits of this memory, it should
	  probably use more.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>__code</title>
	<para>
	  All executable code must live in this address space, but
	  you can stick read-only data here too. It is addressed
	  using the 16-bit address register and special 'code'
	  access opcodes. Anything read-only should live in this space.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>__bit</title>
	<para>
	  The 8051 has 128 bits of bit-addressible memory that
	  lives in the __data segment from 0x20 through
	  0x2f. Special instructions access these bits
	  in a single atomic operation. This isn't so much a
	  separate address space as a special addressing mode for
	  a few bytes in the __data segment.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>__sfr, __sfr16, __sfr32, __sbit</title>
	<para>
	  Access to physical registers in the device use this mode
	  which declares the variable name, it's type and the
	  address it lives at. No memory is allocated for these
	  variables.
	</para>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Function calls on the 8051</title>
      <para>
	Because stack addressing is expensive, and stack space
	limited, the default function call declaration in SDCC
	allocates all parameters and local variables in static global
	memory. Just like fortran. This makes these functions
	non-reentrant, and also consume space for parameters and
	locals even when they are not running. The benefit is smaller
	code and faster execution.
      </para>
      <section>
	<title>__reentrant functions</title>
	<para>
	  All functions which are re-entrant, either due to recursion
	  or due to a potential context switch while executing, should
	  be marked as __reentrant so that their parameters and local
	  variables get allocated on the stack. This ensures that
	  these values are not overwritten by another invocation of
	  the function.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Functions which use significant amounts of space for
	  arguments and/or local variables and which are not often
	  invoked can also be marked as __reentrant. The resulting
	  code will be larger, but the savings in memory are
	  frequently worthwhile.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Non __reentrant functions</title>
	<para>
	  All parameters and locals in non-reentrant functions can
	  have data space decoration so that they are allocated in
	  __xdata, __pdata or __data space as desired. This can avoid
	  consuming __data space for infrequently used variables in
	  frequently used functions.
	</para>
	<para>
	  All library functions called by SDCC, including functions
	  for multiplying and dividing large data types, are
	  non-reentrant. Because of this, interrupt handlers must not
	  invoke any library functions, including the multiply and
	  divide code.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>__interrupt functions</title>
	<para>
	  Interrupt functions are declared with with an __interrupt
	  decoration that includes the interrupt number. SDCC saves
	  and restores all of the registers in these functions and
	  uses the 'reti' instruction at the end so that they operate
	  as stand-alone interrupt handlers. Interrupt functions may
	  call the ao_wakeup function to wake AltOS tasks.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>__critical functions and statements</title>
	<para>
	  SDCC has built-in support for suspending interrupts during
	  critical code. Functions marked as __critical will have
	  interrupts suspended for the whole period of
	  execution. Individual statements may also be marked as
	  __critical which blocks interrupts during the execution of
	  that statement. Keeping critical sections as short as
	  possible is key to ensuring that interrupts are handled as
	  quickly as possible.
	</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>Task functions</title>
    <para>
      This chapter documents how to create, destroy and schedule AltOS tasks.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>ao_add_task</title>
      <programlisting>
	void
	ao_add_task(__xdata struct ao_task * task,
	            void (*start)(void),
	            __code char *name);
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	This initializes the statically allocated task structure,
	assigns a name to it (not used for anything but the task
	display), and the start address. It does not switch to the
	new task. 'start' must not ever return; there is no place
	to return to.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>ao_exit</title>
      <programlisting>
	void
	ao_exit(void)
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	This terminates the current task.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>ao_sleep</title>
      <programlisting>
	void
	ao_sleep(__xdata void *wchan)
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	This suspends the current task until 'wchan' is signaled
	by ao_wakeup, or until the timeout, set by ao_alarm,
	fires. If 'wchan' is signaled, ao_sleep returns 0, otherwise
	it returns 1. This is the only way to switch to another task.
      </para>
      <para>
	Because ao_wakeup wakes every task waiting on a particular
	location, ao_sleep should be used in a loop that first
	checks the desired condition, blocks in ao_sleep and then
	rechecks until the condition is satisfied. If the
	location may be signaled from an interrupt handler, the
	code will need to block interrupts by using the __critical
	label around the block of code. Here's a complete example:
	<programlisting>
	  __critical while (!ao_radio_done)
	          ao_sleep(&amp;ao_radio_done);
	</programlisting>
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>ao_wakeup</title>
      <programlisting>
	void
	ao_wakeup(__xdata void *wchan)
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	Wake all tasks blocked on 'wchan'. This makes them
	available to be run again, but does not actually switch
	to another task. Here's an example of using this:
	<programlisting>
	  if (RFIF &amp; RFIF_IM_DONE) {
	          ao_radio_done = 1;
	          ao_wakeup(&amp;ao_radio_done);
	          RFIF &amp;= ~RFIF_IM_DONE;
	  }
	</programlisting>
	Note that this need not be enclosed in __critical as the
	ao_sleep block can only be run from normal mode, and so
	this sequence can never be interrupted with execution of
	the other sequence.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>ao_alarm</title>
      <programlisting>
	void
	ao_alarm(uint16_t delay)
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	Schedules an alarm to fire in at least 'delay' ticks. If
	the task is asleep when the alarm fires, it will wakeup
	and ao_sleep will return 1.
	<programlisting>
	  ao_alarm(ao_packet_master_delay);
	  __critical while (!ao_radio_dma_done)
	          if (ao_sleep(&amp;ao_radio_dma_done) != 0)
	                  ao_radio_abort();
	</programlisting>
	In this example, a timeout is set before waiting for
	incoming radio data. If no data is received before the
	timeout fires, ao_sleep will return 1 and then this code
	will abort the radio receive operation.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>ao_start_scheduler</title>
      <programlisting>
	void
	ao_start_scheduler(void)
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	This is called from 'main' when the system is all
	initialized and ready to run. It will not return.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>ao_clock_init</title>
      <programlisting>
	void
	ao_clock_init(void)
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	This turns on the external 48MHz clock then switches the
	hardware to using it. This is required by many of the
	internal devices like USB. It should be called by the
	'main' function first, before initializing any of the
	other devices in the system.
      </para>
    </section>
  </chapter>
  <chapter>
    <title>Timer Functions</title>
    <para>
      AltOS sets up one of the cc1111 timers to run at 100Hz and
      exposes this tick as the fundemental unit of time. At each
      interrupt, AltOS increments the counter, and schedules any tasks
      waiting for that time to pass, then fires off the ADC system to
      collect current data readings. Doing this from the ISR ensures
      that the ADC values are sampled at a regular rate, independent
      of any scheduling jitter.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>ao_time</title>
      <programlisting>
	uint16_t
	ao_time(void)
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	Returns the current system tick count. Note that this is
	only a 16 bit value, and so it wraps every 655.36 seconds.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>ao_delay</title>
      <programlisting>
	void
	ao_delay(uint16_t ticks);
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	Suspend the current task for at least 'ticks' clock units.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>ao_timer_set_adc_interval</title>
      <programlisting>
	void
	ao_timer_set_adc_interval(uint8_t interval);
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	This sets the number of ticks between ADC samples. If set
	to 0, no ADC samples are generated. AltOS uses this to
	slow down the ADC sampling rate to save power.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>ao_timer_init</title>
      <programlisting>
	void
	ao_timer_init(void)
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	This turns on the 100Hz tick using the CC1111 timer 1. It
	is required for any of the time-based functions to
	work. It should be called by 'main' before ao_start_scheduler.
      </para>
    </section>
  </chapter>
  <chapter>
    <title>AltOS Mutexes</title>
    <para>
      AltOS provides mutexes as a basic synchronization primitive. Each
      mutexes is simply a byte of memory which holds 0 when the mutex
      is free or the task id of the owning task when the mutex is
      owned. Mutex calls are checkedâ€”attempting to acquire a mutex
      already held by the current task or releasing a mutex not held
      by the current task will both cause a panic.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>ao_mutex_get</title>
      <programlisting>
	void
	ao_mutex_get(__xdata uint8_t *mutex);
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	Acquires the specified mutex, blocking if the mutex is
	owned by another task.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>ao_mutex_put</title>
      <programlisting>
	void
	ao_mutex_put(__xdata uint8_t *mutex);

      <para>
	Releases the specified mutex, waking up all tasks waiting
	for it.

    <title>CC1111 DMA engine</title>
    <para>
      The CC1111 contains a useful bit of extra hardware in the form
      of five programmable DMA engines. They can be configured to copy
      data in memory, or between memory and devices (or even between
      two devices). AltOS exposes a general interface to this hardware
      and uses it to handle radio and SPI data.
    </para>
    <para>
      Code using a DMA engine should allocate one at startup
      time. There is no provision to free them, and if you run out,
      AltOS will simply panic.
    </para>
    <para>
      During operation, the DMA engine is initialized with the
      transfer parameters. Then it is started, at which point it
      awaits a suitable event to start copying data. When copying data
      from hardware to memory, that trigger event is supplied by the
      hardware device. When copying data from memory to hardware, the
      transfer is usually initiated by software.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>ao_dma_alloc</title>
      <programlisting>
	uint8_t
	ao_dma_alloc(__xdata uint8_t *done)
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	Allocates a DMA engine, returning the identifier. Whenever
	this DMA engine completes a transfer. 'done' is cleared
	when the DMA is started, and then receives the
	AO_DMA_DONE bit on a successful transfer or the
	AO_DMA_ABORTED bit if ao_dma_abort was called. Note that
	it is possible to get both bits if the transfer was
	aborted after it had finished.

    <title>SDCC Stdio interface</title>
    <para>
      AltOS offers a stdio interface over both USB and the RF packet
      link. This provides for control of the device localy or
      remotely. This is hooked up to the stdio functions in SDCC by
      providing the standard putchar/getchar/flush functions. These
      automatically multiplex the two available communication
      channels; output is always delivered to the channel which
      provided the most recent input.

    <title>Command line interface</title>
    <para>
      AltOS includes a simple command line parser which is hooked up
      to the stdio interfaces permitting remote control of the device
      over USB or the RF link as desired. Each command uses a single
      character to invoke it, the remaining characters on the line are
      available as parameters to the command.

      <para>
	This registers a set of commands with the command
	parser. There is a fixed limit on the number of command
	sets, the system will panic if too many are registered.
	Each command is defined by a struct ao_cmds entry:
	<programlisting>

	</programlisting>
	'cmd' is the character naming the command. 'func' is the
	function to invoke and 'help' is a string displayed by the
	'?' command. Syntax errors found while executing 'func'
	should be indicated by modifying the global ao_cmd_status
	variable with one of the following values:

    <title>CC1111 USB target device</title>
    <para>
      The CC1111 contains a full-speed USB target device. It can be
      programmed to offer any kind of USB target, but to simplify
      interactions with a variety of operating systems, AltOS provides
      only a single target device profile, that of a USB modem which
      has native drivers for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. It would be
      easy to change the code to provide an alternate target device if
      necessary.
    </para>
    <para>
      To the rest of the system, the USB device looks like a simple
      two-way byte stream. It can be hooked into the command line
      interface if desired, offering control of the device over the
      USB link. Alternatively, the functions can be accessed directly
      to provide for USB-specific I/O.

      </para>
      <para>
	Note that neither TeleDongle nor TeleMetrum are able to

    <title>CC1111 Serial peripheral</title>
    <para>
      The CC1111 provides two USART peripherals. AltOS uses one for
      asynch serial data, generally to communicate with a GPS device,
      and the other for a SPI bus. The UART is configured to operate
      in 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit framing. The default
      configuration has clock settings for 4800, 9600 and 57600 baud
      operation. Additional speeds can be added by computing
      appropriate clock values.

    <title>CC1111 Radio peripheral</title>
    <para>
      The CC1111 radio transceiver sends and receives digital packets
      with forward error correction and detection. The AltOS driver is
      fairly specific to the needs of the TeleMetrum and TeleDongle
      devices, using it for other tasks may require customization of
      the driver itself. There are three basic modes of operation:
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Telemetry mode. In this mode, TeleMetrum transmits telemetry
	    frames at a fixed rate. The frames are of fixed size. This
	    is strictly a one-way communication from TeleMetrum to
	    TeleDongle.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Packet mode. In this mode, the radio is used to create a
	    reliable duplex byte stream between TeleDongle and
	    TeleMetrum. This is an asymmetrical protocol with
	    TeleMetrum only transmitting in response to a packet sent
	    from TeleDongle. Thus getting data from TeleMetrum to
	    TeleDongle requires polling. The polling rate is adaptive,
	    when no data has been received for a while, the rate slows
	    down. The packets are checked at both ends and invalid
	    data are ignored.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    On the TeleMetrum side, the packet link is hooked into the
	    stdio mechanism, providing an alternate data path for the
	    command processor. It is enabled when the unit boots up in
	    'idle' mode.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    On the TeleDongle side, the packet link is enabled with a
	    command; data from the stdio package is forwarded over the
	    packet link providing a connection from the USB command
	    stream to the remote TeleMetrum device.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Radio Direction Finding mode. In this mode, TeleMetrum
	    constructs a special packet that sounds like an audio tone
	    when received by a conventional narrow-band FM
	    receiver. This is designed to provide a beacon to track
	    the device when other location mechanisms fail.
