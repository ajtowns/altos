    altosui: Gather Tm sensor data in Monitor Idle mode
    
    Tm is pretty much the same as TM for the analog sensors, it's just
    missing the accelerometr. Use the same code for constructing an
    AltosRecord for it

    altos: Need to use 16-bit counts for ao_xmem functions
    
    Trying to use 8-bit counts is a nice optimization which fails when the
    count is larger than 255, as is the case with clearing the flash block
    in the AT45 driver. This bug resulted in the inability to erase
    flights on TeleMetrum v1.0 boards.

    altosui: Leave new_gps indication until gps value is used
    
    During replay, AltosState may not see a new GPS value as soon as it
    lands in the state field as additional records with the same timestamp

    update code and have that clear the new_gps indication.

    altos: Allow products without MS5607
    
    The define for a missing MS5607 was wrong, so anything using the fancy
    multi-sensor data code would break without an MS5607 in place.

    altos: SPI radio - use 1->0 for 'done' and 0->1 for 'ready'
    
    This changes how the SPI radio protocol uses the interrupt
    line. Instead of a pulse indicating operation done, this now uses a 0
    value for done and a 1 value for ready. The key distinction is that
    the master can tell when the slave is waiting for the next command
    instead of hoping that it got done 'soon enough'.

    altos: Mostly working SPI radio link
    
    This includes long delays to avoid overrunning the cc1111 input,
    otherwise it works pretty well. The delays mean that we can't capture
    the reply to a cmac command though, so more work is needed.

    altos: When sharing radio DMA for AES, use it for in instead of out
    
    We look at the out_done value, but not the in_done value; if we use
    the radio DMA for out, we would have to use ao_radio_dma_done to check
    for completion. This way, we can ignore that value and use the
    existing ao_aes_dma_out_done value.

    Note that this shows that the 74hc597 driver doesn't work, and that
    the circuit used in telefire v0.1 can't work.

    altos: get MPU6000 I2C link working reliably
    
    This slows the i2c bus to 100kHz (yuck), sets the rise time to spec
    (it was way off) and adds more delays during bus setup. I've run this
    for hours now without trouble. Will try to adjust things back to fast
    mode and see if I can make that work as 100kHz isn't fast enough to
    reliably get data at 100 samples/sec.

    altos: Crank down STM SPI speed for MM
    
    The cc1120 is noisy enough to break SPI data transfers at 4MHz, so
    crank things down to 1MHz. It's "stable" now, but clearly needs a
    filter and shorter traces.

    altos: Add support for multiple SPI busses and sharing device drivers
    
    The STM32L151 has several SPI busses, and we want to use more than
    one, so add a 'bus' parameter to the SPI interfaces. To avoid wasting
    time on AVR and CC1111 processors which only use one SPI bus, elide
    those parameters from the actual functions by wrapping them with
    macros.
    
    Configuring chip select is now all macroized so that each chip can
    have its own version, allowing the STM to share the various SPI device
    drivers with the cc1111 and avr processors. Note that only the M25
    driver has been ported; porting the others is 'trivial', but not
    necessary at this point.

Date:   Mon Apr 9 00:05:18 2012 -0700

    altos: Allow STM DMA channels to be reserved for one use
    
    This allows a single user of a DMA channel to reserve it for use
    without needing to lock the mutex; this is required for DMA from the
    ADC to work on megametrum as it wants to start DMA from an interrupt
    handler, which cannot block on a mutex.

    altos: Make ao_xmem funcs require __xdata void * instead of casting
    
    Having an explicit cast in the ao_xmem wrapper macros caused the
    compiler to generate garbage values for pdata addresses, making the
    upper byte 0x00 instead of the required 0xf0. Removing the
    casts from the ao_xmem macros exposed this problem, so a new
    PDATA_TO_XDATA macros was added, along with a CODE_TO_XDATA macro
    which serve to cast pointers, with suitable address modifications, so
    that things work again.

    altos/avr: SPI mutex is now held by the caller, not the SPI driver
    
    SPI transactions generally require a read followed by a write, with
    the chip select held the whole time. As a result, the SPI bus must be
    held across multiple transactions. To make this reliable, the caller
    must hold the SPI mutex, instead of the underlying SPI driver.

Author: Keith Packard <keithp@keithp.com>
Date:   Sat Oct 8 22:19:52 2011 -0600

    altos: Improve TM v1.0 apogee estimate
    
    v1.0 boards have noisy accelerometer data caused by interactions
    between RF transmission and the accelerometer measurements; this noise
    generates a negative bias in the accelerometer readings. The net
    effect is that the estimated speed is lower than the actual speed,
    causing early an apogee estimate.
    
    By increasing the sigma value for accelerometer data, the kalman
    filter 'trusts' the acceleration data less, putting more weight on the
    barometer data. This causes the estimated time of apogee to be closer
    to the correct value.
    
    This reduces the response to changes in acceleration.
    
    This new value is applied solely to TeleMetrum v1.0 boards. v1.1
    boards correct for this error, and hence can use the correct sigma
    value for the accelerometer.

    TM and Tm go into idle mode if they receive a packet after boot

    master would be (rapidly) polling the device for additional data and
    so the device would invariably receive a packet during bootup and go
    into idle mode again.
    
    Delay the reboot by a second to give the controller time to disable
    the master end of the packet link.

    Setting the radio calibration erases any previous radio setting as
    the radio calibration change invalidates any previously computed radio

    Hence, the radio setting must be configured *after* the radio
    calibration value lest it be ignored.

    altos: Require sequencing through 'main' state before landing
    
    The old version of the code would permit the flight to go straight
    from 'drogue' to 'landed' without passing through 'main' at all. This
    meant that a false landing detection would leave the main charge
    unfired, potentially causing the airframe to land on drogue alone.
    
    Requiring that the flight sequence pass through main ensures that the
    main charge will get fired at the right time, although if the airframe
    lands higher than that altitude, it will not go to 'landed' mode ever.

    altos: Average height values for landing detection
    
    Instead of using the direct output of the kalman filter and hoping
    that is quiet enough to detect landing, filter that with a long
    exponential decay filter and then check to make sure that doesn't
    change more than 2m in 5 seconds as a trigger for landing detection.
    
    Tested with existing telemetrum flight logs and it correctly detects

    altos: Complete new telemetry switchover
    
    This involved rewriting the GPS code to use the telemetry structures
    directly so that a memcpy could be used to transfer the data to the
    telemetry packets, saving a bunch of code space, along with fixing up
    the gps testing programs to deal with the structure changes.
    
    In addition, the teledongle code needed to have the monitoring code
    split into separate radio receiver and USB writer threads as the
    packets are now back-to-back, and hence come too fast to wait for the
    USB data to be sent to the host after each one.

     ao_flight.c: Flight state management, specific to rocketry.
    
    The plan is to re-use ao_sample.c and ao_kalman.c for hardware not

    For the timeout dialog to appear, a frame must be configured for it to

    download is still trying to talk to the serial device from the swing

    altos: full logging must flush pending data before checking state
    
    Flight state must be checked only after any pending data have been
    written to the log as the 'current' flight state is only valid when
    the pending data values have been processed. This ensures that the
    'boost' state is not marked until the full ring of data is
    written. This ensures that the data processing code can find the
    barometer values from before boost to get an idea of the ground
    pressure value.

    altos/kalman: Kalman terms can be > 1, use 32-bit fixed point
    
    Because speed and acceleration are scaled by 16, it's fairly common
    for the kalman terms to end up larger than 1. Instead of trying to
    fuss with 16-bit values and shifts, just use 32-bit values.

    altos: Compute a 'trust' value for the barometer
    
    Instead of making the baro use/don't-use decision binary, use a 'trust

    eliminates bumps in the data from a rapid shift.

    altos: Switch telemetrum over to kalman filter
    
    This changes the full telemetry stream to include kalman data instead
    of the old ad-hoc flight data. It's compatible in that the packet
    sizes are the same so teledongle can receive either and figure out
    which it has received.
    
    A few plotting and testing tools are added to make validating the new
    code easier.

    altos: New telemetry report format (version 4). Supports tiny telemetry.
    
    This completely replaces the version 3 format with a much simpler and
    easier to parse scheme. It's described in detail in ao_telem.h, but
    the basic idea is that the whole line is split into name/value pairs,
    separated by whitespace. Every name is unique, and the values are
    either strings or integers. No extraneous formatting or units are
    provided.

    altos: Split out tiny telemetry from full telemetry
    
    The TeleMini and TeleNano boards do not have either GPS or
    accelermeters, and they also run the kalman filter which produces
    standard unit measurements for the flight height/speed/accel
    values. This makes the telemetry significantly
    different. ao_telemetry_tiny.c sends the required data.
    
    Note that TeleNano sends the same telemetry as telemini at this point;
    there are a couple of values which are not useful, but the overhead of
    sending them is small enough that the hassle of having three telemetry
    formats seemed excessive.

    altos: Make telemetry interval more consistent
    
    Instead of using a delay between telemetry packets, use a telemetry
    period and compute an appropriate delay each time. This requires
    changing the ascent telemetry from a 50ms delay to a 100ms interval,
    to provide a regular 10 packets-per-second rate. Before, we counted on
    the telemetry packet taking about 50ms to send so that we would
    receive about 10 per second.
    
    This also eliminates delays during descent for RDF tones -- those will
    get transmitted in the interval between telemetry packets without
    interrupting the spacing of those packets.

    Instead of setting the packet size at configuration time, use the
    provided packet size to the send/recv functions to configure the

    mode and 'packet' mode, the latter working for telemetry and the
    bi-directional link.

    altos: Don't init packet slave on TD. Make slave start optional
    
    Oops. TeleDongle was starting the packet slave code, which kinda
    wrecked its ability to receive telemetry packets. This patch simply
    removes the packet slave code from teledongle as it cannot be used
    (yet), it also makes the packet slave code initialization take a
    parameter which controls whether to start that by default; in the
    future, perhaps TeleDongle will gain a command to start packet slave mode.

    altosui: Always read whole eeprom block, even at end of flight
    
    Instead of stopping early, continue reading the whole eeprom block so
    that the extra serial data doesn't end up confusing the next user of
    the serial line, which may well be reading the next flight.

    When reading empty eeprom records, mark them as 'invalid', but don't
    generate an exception as it's normal to read these at the end of the
    flight log.

    The flight test code had static accelerometer configuration values,
    making it impossible to use data from different boards without

    altos: Use 5V reference data to correct accelerometer measurements.
    
    When the 3.3V and 5V values shift relative to each other (usually due
    to changes in power consumption), the measured acceleration will
    appear to shift. This patch converts the 3.3V referenced acceleration
    value into a 5V referenced acceleration, eliminating this error.

    altos: clean up radio abort paths. Share radio code.
    
    Instead of aborting the DMA and radio operation and expecting that to
    be handled reasonably by the radio receiving task, rewrite things so
    that the abort function just wakes the receiving task while that
    terminates the DMA and cleans up the radio.
    
    This eliminates all kinds of nasty bugs dealing with radio abort
    smashing the radio registers at the wrong time, or interrupting a
    radio transmission.

    altosui: When fixing eeprom gps time information, make GPS data valid
    
    Eeprom files may be missing the GPS time (due to a firmware bug). Working
    around this involves finding the next valid GPS time and using that to
    create a fake GPS time entry. However, that next GPS time may not
    be locked or may have few sats as it is from the boost stage of the
    flight. Fix this by simply forcing the fake time packet to have

    altosui: Rewrite info table to mix with scroll pane well. Fix startup size
    
    Using a single table for the info table means that the scroll pane
    automatically picks up the table headers and shows them above the
    scrollable view.
    
    This patch also fixes the application size at startup so that no
    scrollbar is required in the info table, and the window is < 800x600.

    altosui: Deal with eeprom dates going backwards across wrap
    
    eeprom timestamps can go backwards as the GPS time stamps are
    recorded when the first GPS character is received, but not placed into
    the eeprom log until the last GPS packet is complete. If this happens
    at the same time the tick count is wrapping, then the tick count will
    wrap backwards across the 0 boundary causing time to jump forwards.
    
    Fix this by letting time go backwards across the tick boundary, which
    requires that we know when the first 'real' tick is read from the
    eeprom file.

    altosui: conflating USB product and vendor IDs is a bad idea
    
    We've now got a USB vendor ID called 'altusmetrum' for generic
    altusmetrum devices (old USB ID 0x000A) while the general vendor name
    for all devices is 'altusmetrum' as well.
    
    This patch splits vendors and products into separate name spaces,
    products are prefixed with product_ and vendor with (oddly) vendor_.

    When flight status changes rapidly, the queue of voice data can get

    periodic reporting until a suitable time after that, second it ensures
    that the voice data has all been delivered before generating a new
    altitude report.

    altosui: Allow 'connect to device' when already connected
    
    Opening another serial device involves shutting down the display
    thread (to reset its state) and spawning another one. Shutting down
    the display thread normally closes the serial device as a part of the
    process, and if this isn't done before the new serial device is
    opened, then the new serial device ends up getting closed too.
    
    Interrupting the display thread and waiting for it to stop before
    opening the new serial device solves the problem.

    altosui: Deal with altos bug setting radio channel while monitoring
    
    If the monitoring thread is active, then setting the radio channel can
    sometimes cause the monitoring thread to get stuck. I'm not entirely
    sure why though. For now, work around the issue by making sure
    monitoring is off, and the monitoring thread has stopped, before
    changing the radio channel.

    altosui: provide separate flush_input/flush_output for serial. deal with monitor automatically
    
    (yes, this should be two patches, but the diffs in AltosSerial were merged together).
    
    First, this replaces the existing flush/flush_reply mess with two simple functions,
    one to flush output to the serial device, making sure that all data written will be seen
    while we wait for input. The other sucks any pending input off of the serial line and
    discards it.
    
    Second, AltosSerial now tracks whether the serial line is being used for telemetry
    monitoring. If so, it enables monitoring, otherwise it disables it. Eliminates a
    bunch of manual state tracking elsewhere.

    altosui: flush replies from serial link when entering debug mode
    
    We use replies in debug mode a lot and depend on them matching the
    expected parameters. The case which caused trouble was using
    TeleMetrum to reprogram TeleDongle -- sending the 'm 0' command (to
    disable telemetry monitoring on TeleDongle) to the TeleMetrum caused
    it to reply 'Syntax Error' which confused the subsequent flashing
    operation. Flushing that reply gets things back in sync.

    altos: Place rom config variables in fixed location
    
    The device serial number and radio calibration values are stored in
    flash, mostly so that TeleDongle gets them saved.
    
    Placing them in well-known locations (starting at 0xa0) makes it
    possible to find the previous configuration and to re-write it
    easily, without requiring the .map file.
    
    altosui doesn't have the .map file parsing code, so it relies upon
    this new technique. As a benefit, it reads the old values from the
    device before reprogramming it.

    altos: Define USB product ID in per-product Makefile.defs file
    
    This allows Win7 to tell which kind of device is connected purely by
    USB id as it doesn't expose the USB product ID string to user space.

    altosui: Select devices by USB vendor/product ID.
    
    Because Win7 doesn't expose the product name, we're swtiching to using
    the USB idProduct/idVendor values. This patch adds support for
    selecting devices by those new IDs.

    libaltos: integrate Windows support.
    
    This adds Windows support for discovery and I/O.
    
    The API to the library is mostly unchanged, except that it now exports
    product and vendor USB IDs as Win7 doesn't expose the product name
    anywhere that we've been able to find, so we'll be updating the
    firmware to use unique idProduct values for each product.

    Make ao_log_data re-entrant as it is used for both sensor and GPS logs
    
    Because ao_log_data is called from two different threads, failing to
    make it re-entrant would cause the 'log' pointer parameter to get
    overwritten if another thread asked to log data while the eeprom was
    busy writing out a block.
    
    This would cause the second thread to re-writing data from the first
    thread's address, but without re-checksumming the data as the checksum
    is computed before the log mutex is taken.
    
    The bug can be seen by log blocks with invalid checksums.
    
    Here's what happens with the ao_gps_tracking_report and ao_log threads:
    
      ao_gps_tracking_report		ao_log
    
       Writes a bunch of records
       *blocks* in the eeprom flush
    					sets ao_log_data 'log' to global 'log'
    					computes checksum for 'log' block
    					*blocks* on ao_log_mutex
       Wakes up
       sets ao_log_data 'log' to 'gps_log'
       writes remaining records
       'gps_log' is left with svid = 0
       *blocks* on ao_gps_tracking_data
    					writes data, reading from
    					the current ao_log_data 'log'
    					pointer which points at 'gps_log'
    
    Making ao_log_data re-entrant fixes this by ensuring that the 'ao_log'
    thread has its own copy of the ao_log_data 'log' parameter.
    
    I made this function take an __xdata restricted pointer so that it
    could be passed in the dptr register instead of needing to go on the stack.

    When the EP0 IN buffer is full, don't panic, just skip sending another
    
    If the host doesn't pull the IN packet out of EP0 before sending
    another SETUP command along, the IN buffer will still be busy when we
    try to reply to the SETUP command. While I don't quite understand why
    this would ever happen, there's no need to panic about it, just drop
    the reply packet on the floor.

    Switch DBG pins to GPIO when using any debug commands. Reboot to restore.
    
    If you want to use TeleMetrum as a debug dongle, you need to flip the
    three pins used to talk to the remote debug port from SPI mode to GPIO
    mode.
    
    This patch doesn't provide any way to get back to SPI mode, so you'll
    have to reboot the TeleMetrum to write out config parameters or log
    flight data after using any debug commands.

    Don't change dbg clock while changing reset_n. Use 20ms everywhere
    
    This changes the reset code to be more conservative about changing
    things at the same time, and also sets all timings to 20ms to make
    debugging with the scope easier.

    Oh, right SDCC has '__critical' to mark sections of code that need to
    run with interrupts disabled; no need to use EA = 0 and EA = 1.

    Disable interrupts while reading from stdin
    
    With multiple input source support, there is a lag between asking a
    device if it has data and then waiting for more data to appear. If an
    interrupt signalling additional input arrives in this interval, we'll
    go to sleep with input available.
    
    This patch uses a big hammer by just disabling interrupts for the
    whole process.

    Only have the slave return a packet if it received one.
    
    When the receive is aborted to switch modes, it's important to not
    immediately re-acquire the radio and try to send a packet as the
    aborting thread won't know to kick the receiver again.
    
    This prevents the 'C' command from locking up as it tries to stop the
    packet slave before turning on the transmitter.

    When changing RESET line, delay 20ms
    
    The GPS data sheet suggests a 1uF cap on the reset line to ensure it
    is held low long enough for the power supply to come up to voltage. TM
    v1.0 loads a 0.001uF cap there, but in case that isn't large enough,
    it could be replaced with the larger one. This change makes sure that
    even with that larger value, the debugging link will be able to reset
    the target.

    Round radio calibration value instead of truncating
    
    The radio calibration function in the bring-up code was truncating the
    radio calibration value which caused the resulting frequency to
    always measure above the target frequency, instead of trying to get as
    close as possible. This change will result in a closer frequency
    match, but may sometimes be below the target frequency.

    Eliminate deadlock when writing config from radio link
    
    Writing the 'Saved\r\n' string would fill the packet buffer and cause
    a flush to occur, which would need to wait for the radio link to
    receive and transmit a packet. The radio link always re-fetches the
    radio channel number when lighting up the radio, so it need to look in
    the config space. If the config mutex was held by the config writing
    process while the radio was trying to get the channel number, then
    we'd get a deadlock.

    Use ao_radio_get/ao_radio_put in packet code.
    
    The ao_radio_get function both acquires the mutex *and* configures the
    radio channel and frequency. Failing to use this in the packet code
    would leave the radio frequency unconfigured.

    Extract flight number from either telemetry or eeprom files and use

    add a new field, -seq-%03d. This is appended only when the sequence
    number is non-zero as it shouldn't occur in normal usage.
    
    This also eliminates some duplicate filename creation code in the

    Add two-point accelerometer calibration.
    
    Calibration now uses two values, one upside right and the other upside
    down instead of a single horizontal value. This allows the use of
    other accelerometers and compensates for variations in the divider
    circuit to provide more accurate data.

    Fix cc_period_make to not get stuck on samples with matching time
    
    When two samples have matching times, step to the second one;
    otherwise, we'll get stuck forever.

    Color plots, integrate only flight portion of data.
    
    Telemetry files have piles of pad data which shouldn't be integrated
    into the velocity data as it tends to generate huge values from the
    noise of the sensor.
    
    Also make the data lines colored to keep them visually distinct from
    the rest of the plot image.

    Make RDF beacon only run on pad and after landing.
    
    It's pretty much impossible to RDF the rocket during flight, and it
    interferes with the telemetry data stream. Leave it enabled on the pad
    so that radios can be tested, and then re-enable it once the rocket
    has landed.
    
    This patch also turns the rdf 'on' time into a parameter so it can be
    changed, and then sets that parameter to 500ms, once every 5 seconds.

    Remove unused cctools code paths for old libusb and cp2103 ioctls.
    
    Communication with the CP2103 board has gone through three revisions,
    first using ioctls supported by the CP2103 kernel driver, then using
    the old synchronous usb library and now using the newer libusb
    asynchronous interface. There's no reason to keep shipping the old
    stale code now that the new stuff works reliably.

    with this switch.

    While on the pad, zero out velocity every second
    
    We integrate acceleration to get velocity, but that means sitting on the pad
    for a long time can add substantial error to the velocity value. Each
    second, take the velocity value from a full second ago and subtract that out
    of the current velocity. Once we detect boost, this will stop, which means
    that as long as we detect boost within a second, we won't have subtracted
    out any "real" velocity.
    
    This keeps the pad velocity hovering around zero, which is pretty useful.

    Use 'char' instead of 'uint8_t' for character data
    
    String and character constants are of char type, so using uint8_t causes
    promotion to 16-bit types when comparing the two.

    Eliminate incorrect cast in printf string argument
    
    char * is a pointer to a string in the default address space, not a generic pointer
    to a string. As such, the compiler (at least 2.9.0) mis-compiles this if the
    cast is included.

    right off the pad as we're not going very fast at that point...
    
    This also adds the 'f' command to show the current flight status on the USB

    Add radio support. Build separate executables for TeleMetrum and the TI dongle
    
    Ok, way too big a patch, but things were in rough shape.
    This patch adds support for the radio, both transmit and receive.
    Then, because I could no longer run the TeleMetrum code on the TI
    dongle, I ended up building a separate image for the TI board, which
    involved creating a mechanism for having multiple command sets and splitting
    code for different functions into different files.

    Wait for a while when switching the RESET_N line
    
    The cc1111 manual suggests placing a 2.7kΩ resister and 1nF capacitor on the
    RESET_N line to filter out noise. This increases the time necessary to reset
    the chip to several microseconds which is longer than the interval between
    two USB packets. Flush the USB packet queue and sleep for a while after
    changing the value on the RESET_N line to make sure the chip sees the state
    change.

    Add s51 manual.
    
    This documents (briefly) the s51 hex debugging interface program, including
    some simple commands to test the operation of the system interactively.

    Save/restore registers to host during memory operations. Cache ROM data.
    
    Because the debug port uses instructions for most operations, the debug code
    will clobber registers used by the running program. Save and restore these
    to avoid corrupting application data.
    
    If the ROM file is known, use that to return data instead of fetching it
    from the target to improve performance.

    Fix flashing less than a full page of data. Verify page at a time.
    
    The 8051 flashing code requires special help with counts with non-zero low
    byte. Also, instead of verifying the entire flash contents at the end,
    verify each page as it goes.

    Use SFR access funcs. Support 'dump' command. Add -m (monitor) flag.
    
    Not all SFRs are visible in the unified address space, so the SFR-specific
    accessors are required.
    
    The dump command is the same as the various 'd*'
    commands, but also supports dumping program memory.
    
    The new -m (monitor) flag watches the command stream between s51 and sdcdb.

    Save/restore regs when reading/writing memory. Add SFR access.
    
    The DPL and ACC registers are used by the memory access code,
    so they need to be saved and restored. Stuff them up high in ram for now;
    this should probably be fixed to pull them back to the host instead.
    
    Special SFR access is required as not all SFRs are visible in the unified
    address space.

    s51: get start address from ihx file. re-enable breakpoints after reset.
    
    Use the start of the ihx file when asked to run from 0x0, this lets
    sdcdb run programs from ram.
    
    The reset command clears all hw breakpoints, so reset them afterwards.

    Switch to libusb-1.0 and use async interface.
    
    The async libusb interface offers substantial performance benefits by not
    making each command wait for the reply. This makes talking over this

    Add preliminary version of s51, a UI clone of the 8051 emulator.
    
    sdcdb provides source-level debugging using the 8051 emulator, s51. By
    emulating that emulator a the UI level, we should be able to get source
    debugging right on our target platform.
    
    This is just the preliminary structure for the program with most commands
    not yet implemented.
